/// Simple static tracking for duplicate prevention
///
/// This class provides minimal global state tracking
/// specifically for preventing
/// duplicate modal sheets when users click buttons multiple times quickly.
/// It maintains a clean architecture by only tracking what's necessary.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// * ðŸš« **Duplicate prevention** - Prevents multiple sheets from same anchor
/// * ðŸ”„ **Toggle behavior** - Second click on same button dismisses sheet
/// * ðŸ§¹ **Auto-cleanup** - Automatically clears when controller is disposed
/// * ðŸ“¦ **Minimal footprint** - Only tracks active controller and anchor key
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// // Check for duplicates before creating new sheet
/// if (ActiveSheetTracker.hasActive &&
///     anchorKey == ActiveSheetTracker.currentAnchorKey) {
///   ActiveSheetTracker.currentController?.dismiss();
///   return; // Don't create duplicate
/// }
///
/// // Track new active sheet
/// ActiveSheetTracker.setActive(controller, anchorKey);
/// ```
///
/// ## Automatic Cleanup
///
/// The tracker automatically clears itself when controllers are disposed,
/// preventing memory leaks and stale references.
class ActiveSheetTracker {
  /// Private storage for the currently active controller
  ///
  /// This is the controller for the most recently opened anchored sheet.
  /// It's cleared automatically when the controller is disposed.

  ///
  /// This tracks which UI element (button, etc.) opened the current sheet.
  /// Used for duplicate prevention and toggle behavior.

  /// * [controller] - The modal controller for the new active sheet
  /// * [anchorKey] -
