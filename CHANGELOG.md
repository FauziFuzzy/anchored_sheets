## [1.1.3] - 2025-08-22

### Fixed
- **Type Safety**: Fixed `_TypeError` when casting between different `GenericModalController` types
  - Resolved issue where `GenericModalController<String>` could not be cast to `GenericModalController<bool>?`
  - Implemented type-safe checking in `getCurrentController()` and `getCurrentState()` methods
  - Made controller dismissal work regardless of generic type parameters
- **Context-based Dismissal**: Fixed `context.popAnchoredSheet()` not working properly
  - Re-enabled fallback to `dismissAnchoredSheet()` when `ModalDismissProvider` is not found
  - Improved dismissal reliability across different anchored sheet types
- **Provider Integration**: Enhanced state management with Provider pattern
  - Implemented real-time UI updates in anchored sheets
  - Added `AppState` provider for centralized state management
  - Filter sheet now updates UI immediately when selections change

### Added
- **Best Practices Example**: Comprehensive Provider-based state management implementation
  - Reactive UI updates without waiting for sheet dismissal
  - Proper separation of concerns between UI and business logic
  - Material Design 3 integration with proper theming

### Technical Improvements
- Type-safe controller storage and retrieval
- Dynamic type checking to prevent runtime casting errors
- Improved error handling and debugging messages
- Better fallback mechanisms for dismissal operations

## [1.1.2] - 2025-08-22

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Updated dismissal API to prioritize context-based approach
  - `context.popAnchoredSheet()` is now the primary recommended method for dismissing sheets
  - `dismissAnchoredSheet()` is kept for backward compatibility but no longer preferred
  - Updated all examples and documentation to use the new pattern
  - Improved fallback handling for dismissal methods

### Updated
- All example code now uses `context.popAnchoredSheet()`
- Documentation updated to reflect the preferred dismissal approach
- Test files updated to use the new API
